## üé® My Pookalam

### Description

*A Digital Onam Pookalam: Tradition Meets Generative Art**
This Python script generates a vibrant and intricate digital Pookalam, a traditional floral carpet central to the Onam celebrations here in Kerala. The design captures the essence of this beautiful art form, blending the structured symmetry of a traditional Pookalam with the infinite variability of generative art.

**The Design Philosophy**

The final image is a high-resolution, radially symmetric floral masterpiece. It is built from the outside in, with dozens of concentric rings creating a mesmerizing sense of depth and complexity. The colours are drawn from a palette of flowers deeply familiar to the Onam festival‚Äîthe bright oranges and yellows of marigolds, the deep red of the hibiscus, and the pure white of jasmine, all set against a white/transparent background.

The design's key feature is its transition in texture. The outer rings are orderly, with flowers arranged in subtle, wave-like patterns. As the rings move closer to the center, the flowers become slightly larger and overlap, creating a softer, fuller appearance. The design culminates in a densely packed, vibrant core where all the flowers are scattered in a random yet harmonious mix, ensuring no gaps and creating a lush focal point.

### Features
- The code functions as a generative artist, following a set of rules and parameters to "build" the Pookalam from scratch.
- **Controlled Randomness:** The script intelligently selects a random sequence of flower types for the rings, ensuring each generated Pookalam is unique in its colour combination and flow.
- **Pattern Engines:** For each ring, a simple mathematical pattern (like a wave or zigzag) is applied to the flower placements. This introduces an organic, non-rigid order to the design, preventing it from     looking too robotic.
- **Density and Overlap:** By adjusting parameters like layers_per_ring and spacing_factor, the code controls how tightly the flowers are packed. The logic is specifically modified to increase the size of the flowers in the innermost rings to create a deliberate, soft overlap.
